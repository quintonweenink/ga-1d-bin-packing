### Multiple Sequence Alignment using Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization

*Abstract:* Investigate how to achieve Multiple Sequence Alignment using multi-objective particle swarm optimization. While many multi-objective optimisation techniques exist this paper will investigate the performance of vector evaluated particle swarm optimization to optimise the required objectives.
