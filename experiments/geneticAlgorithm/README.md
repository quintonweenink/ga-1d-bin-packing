### Offline One-dimensional Bin Packing using a Genetic Algorithm

*Abstract:* This report aims to investigate solving the offline one-dimensional bin packing problems using a Genetic Algorithm. This involves choosing a fitness function, correct selection method and genetic operators which suite the problem.

#### Getting Started:

##### Install dependencies:
You will need python installed to run the application
`sudo -H pip3 install numpy`

If you would like to see graphs you will need to install matplotlib and enable the variable in the code

##### Running a simulation:

From the root of the project (Where this README.md file is)
1. Extract the `bin1data`, `bin2data` and `bin3data` into the root folder.
2. Run `python3 1dPacking.py`
3. You may need to run `export PYTHONPATH='.'` if python is struggling to find numpy.
